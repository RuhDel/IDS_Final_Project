# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Project

## Overview
This project is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) developed as part of a cybersecurity course assignment. The IDS is designed to detect system anomalies, intrusions, and various types of cyberattacks using advanced data processing and machine learning/deep learning techniques. The project simulates real-time network activities, processes the data, and presents findings through a user-friendly dashboard.

## Project Structure
The IDS project follows a structured approach to ensure comprehensive detection and analysis:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and prepare the dataset for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze and visualize key features and patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Select and engineer features to optimize model performance.
4. **Model Development**: Train and evaluate machine learning and deep learning models.
5. **Real-Time Simulation**: Simulate network traffic to mimic real-world conditions.
6. **Dashboard Presentation**: Visualize results using an interactive and intuitive dashboard.
7. **Video Presentation**: Summarize the project in a detailed video presentation.

## Dataset
We are using the **CICIDS2017** dataset, which provides a realistic representation of network traffic, including both benign and attack data. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chethuhn/network-intrusion-dataset?resource=download).
